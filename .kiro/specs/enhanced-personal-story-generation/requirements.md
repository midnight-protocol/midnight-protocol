# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current AI interviewer system generates minimal personal stories that fail to capture the rich, multidimensional understanding needed for meaningful networking. This enhancement will transform the system to create deep, holistic user profiles that combine authentic personal understanding with clear outcome mapping, enabling AI agents to discover unexpected, high-value connections that humans would miss.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user completing onboarding, I want the AI to develop a deep, authentic understanding of who I am as a person - my values, thinking patterns, creative process, and what drives me - so that my agent can accurately represent my interests and preferences in networking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI interviewer processes my conversation THEN the system SHALL capture my authentic voice, unique perspective, and core values that define how I approach problems and opportunities
2. WHEN building my profile THEN the system SHALL understand my thinking patterns, creative process, and what energizes me beyond just professional categories
3. WHEN representing me to others THEN my agent SHALL accurately communicate my interests, values, and goals while maintaining its own distinct agent identity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to understand the specific outcomes I'm trying to create in the world, so that my agent can identify people and opportunities that could accelerate those outcomes in ways I haven't imagined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI analyzes my responses THEN the system SHALL identify the concrete changes, results, and impact I want to create
2. WHEN capturing my goals THEN the system SHALL focus on the end states I'm working toward rather than the methods or roles I think I need
3. WHEN evaluating potential connections THEN the system SHALL assess how each person's unique capabilities could contribute to my desired outcomes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my AI agent to synthesize my personal essence with my desired outcomes to discover unexpected, high-value connections that perfectly align with both who I am and what I'm trying to achieve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system matches me with others THEN it SHALL consider both personal compatibility (values, thinking style, energy) AND outcome alignment (how they could help achieve my goals)
2. WHEN identifying opportunities THEN the system SHALL find creative intersections between my authentic self and my desired outcomes that I wouldn't have considered
3. WHEN presenting connections THEN the system SHALL explain both the personal resonance AND the specific outcome potential of each match

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI interviewer to return structured JSON responses, so that the system can properly populate database fields and display organized information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI interviewer generates a personal story update THEN the system SHALL return a structured JSON response with defined schema
2. WHEN processing the JSON response THEN the system SHALL map fields to appropriate database columns
3. WHEN the JSON response is malformed THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and request a retry

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user during onboarding, I want to see my personal story evolve and update in real-time as I chat with the AI interviewer, so that I can see how my responses are being understood and captured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a message to the AI interviewer THEN the system SHALL return both a chat response AND an updated personal story section
2. WHEN the personal story is updated THEN the changes SHALL be immediately visible on the interface without requiring a page refresh
3. WHEN the AI processes my responses THEN the personal story SHALL progressively build and refine with each conversation turn, creating a magical real-time experience

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI interviewer to return structured JSON responses, so that the system can properly populate database fields and update the UI in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI interviewer generates a response THEN the system SHALL return a structured JSON response containing both chat_response and personal_story_update fields
2. WHEN processing the JSON response THEN the system SHALL update both the conversation display and the personal story section simultaneously
3. WHEN the JSON response is malformed THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and request a retry

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to configure the AI interviewer's response format, so that I can toggle between different output modes for testing and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the AI interviewer THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle for "JSON response expected" mode
2. WHEN JSON mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide the AI with the expected response schema
3. WHEN JSON mode is disabled THEN the system SHALL fall back to the current text-based response format
